## Basic Multipanel Layouts with `par()`

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3), cex = 0.6, mar = c(3, 3, 0, 0), oma = c(1, 1, 3, 1))
for (i in 1:6) {
  plot(1, 1, type = "n")
  mtext(letters[i], side = 3, line = -1, adj = 0.1,cex = 0.6)
}
```

## Some of the Common "Tricks"

We can eliminate the redundant axes, remove margin space, and reduce the emphasis
on the structural (non-data) elements of the figure. 



```{r eval=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 3), cex = 0.6, mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5),tcl = -0.25, mgp = c(2, 0.6, 0))
for (i in 1:6) {
  plot(1, axes = FALSE, type = "n")
  mtext(letters[i], side = 3, line = -1, adj = 0.1, cex = 0.6)
  if (i %in% c(4, 5, 6)) axis(1, col = "grey40", col.axis = "grey20", at = seq(0.6, 1.2, 0.2))
  if (i %in% c(1, 4)) axis(2, col = "grey40", col.axis = "grey20", at = seq(0.6, 1.2, 0.2))
  box(col = "grey60")
}

mtext("x axis", side = 1, outer = TRUE, cex = 0.7, line = 2.2, col = "grey20")
mtext("y axis", side = 2, outer = TRUE, cex = 0.7, line = 2.2, col = "grey20")
```

These are some of the frequent ???tricks??? you can use to create a basic multipanel layout that will focus the reader???s attention on trends in the data. If you aren???t familiar with an option for par(), look up the help: `?par`.

mtext("y axis", side = 2, outer = TRUE, cex = 0.7, line = 2.2, col = "grey20")

```


## Fancy Multipanel Layouts with `layout()`

`layout()` takes a matrix and turns it into a layout. The numbers in the matrix correspond to the order that the panels will be plotted in. Cells with the same number represent a single panel.

```{r}
(m <- rbind(c(1, 1), c(2, 3)))
layout(m)
layout.show(3) # The number of the panels to show```
```


## 


## 

We can create some fairly complex layouts with `layout()`. For example, some panels empty can be left empty as margin space. 

```{r }
m <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,7),nrow = 3,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
layout(mat = m,heights = c(0.4,0.4,0.2))
par(oma = c(4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
plot_colors <- c("blue","black", "green", "orange", "pink", "yellow")
for (i in 1:6){
    par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
    plot(runif(5),runif(5), axes=FALSE,col=plot_colors[i])
    if (i %in% c(4, 5, 6)) axis(1, col = "grey40", col.axis = "grey20")
    if (i %in% c(1, 4)) axis(2, col = "grey40", col.axis = "grey20")
    box(col = "grey60")
}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 3, 0))
plot(1, type = "n", axes=FALSE, xlab="", ylab="")
legend(x = "top",inset = 0,
        legend = c("A", "B", "C","D", "D", "E"), 
        col=plot_colors, lwd=5, horiz = TRUE)
?legend
```

We can set parameter values based on other data using `ifelse` function

```{r}
tib = tibble(day = 1:10, value=11:20)
tib

plot(tib$value, col=ifelse(tib$value%%3 == 0, "red","black"), pch=ifelse(tib$value%%2 == 0, 1, 2))
```

In the above example, we can first evaluate the value assigned to `col` and `pch`.
```{r}
(c=ifelse(tib$value%%3 == 0, "red","black"))
(p=ifelse(tib$value%%2 == 0, 1, 2))

```
```plot(x=tib$value, col=ifelse(tib$value%%3 == 0, "red","black"), pch=ifelse(tib$value%%2 == 0, 1, 2))```

is equivalent to 

```plot(x=tib$value, col=c("black", "black", "red", "black", "black", "red", "black", "black", "red", "black"), pch=c(2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1))```

## Task:

You are going to plot a graph to show the stock price, 50-day moving average, 200-day moving average, death cross and golden cross of Facebook and Apple inc. in year 2018.

The datasets is the trimmed data containing the columns `date`, `Adjusted`(Adjusted Price), `x50day.SMA` (50-day simple moving average), `x200day.SMA` (200-day simple moving average) and `cross` (Death/Golden Cross happens on that day)

For the value of `Nday.SMA`, it is the average close price of the previous N day. For example, the 50day.SMA of day 51 is `mean(close_price[1:50])`, where the `close_price` column was removed. The 200day.SMA of day 1000 is `mean(close_price[800:999])`

![Death / Golden Cross](https://gale.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/INDOAMIN_112.25_%E2%96%B20.22_%E2%80%94_Unnamed_%E2%80%94_TradingView_-_2018-10-17_01.43.22.png)

(The red line is 50-day moving average. The blue line is 200-day moving average.)

The death cross is the intersection point of 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA that the 50-day SMA was previously higher than the 200-day SMA but now becomes lower.

The golden cross is the intersection point of 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA that the 50-day SMA was previously lower than the 200-day SMA but now becomes higher.

```{r}
(FB = read_csv("FB.csv"))
(AAPL = read_csv("AAPL.csv"))
tail(AAPL)
```

Here are the sub-tasks you need to complete:

- Plot 2 subgraphs; Upper one is for FB; Lower one is for AAPL;
- For each company(FB and AAPL):
  1. Plot a line graph (value: `Adjusted` column, style: dash line, darkgrey color)
  2. Add a title "COMPANY_NAME stock pring 2018". (You can use `line=-1` to adjust title position)
  3. Add a line to show the 50day-moving average (style: orange color)
  4. Add a line to show the 200day-moving average (style: blue color)
  5. If death cross happens on that day, add a red inverted triangle, and label "Death Cross"; If golden cross happens on that day, add a green triangle, and label "Golden Cross"
  
- For the first graph (FB):

  - remove the x label and xtick
  - add a legend at the bottom right corner
